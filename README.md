# Agentic Testing 101

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a chatbot that can run automated tests using Natural Language Processing (NLP) via Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol). The goal is to enable users to interact with the testing system using natural language commands, making automated testing more accessible and intuitive.

## High-Level Context

- **Chatbot Interface:** Users interact with the system through a chatbot, providing test instructions in natural language.
- **NLP Processing:** The chatbot interprets user commands using NLP techniques to understand the intent and required actions.
- **Playwright MCP Integration:** The interpreted commands are executed as automated tests using Playwright MCP, allowing for robust browser automation and testing.

## Goals

- Simplify the process of writing and running automated tests.
- Enable non-technical users to perform testing using natural language.
- Leverage Playwright MCP for reliable and scalable test execution.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Follow the setup instructions (to be added) to run the chatbot and connect it to Playwright MCP.

## Future Work

- Enhance NLP capabilities for more complex test scenarios.
- Add support for additional testing frameworks.
- Improve chatbot user experience.
